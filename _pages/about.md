My name is Charlemagne (Charlie) Agravante Amao. I am a full-time software developer for [Price Industries](https://www.priceindustries.com/corporate/about-us) and a part-time M.Sc student in Computer Science at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://omscs.gatech.edu), taking courses focused on Machine Learning with Cloud Computing electives.

Previously I had completed a Mechanical Engineering degree with a focus on Robotics and Computer Science, at the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/engineering/mechanical).

This website is a work in-progress, but it is intended to show projects I have worked on over the years.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
